Thermometers (Collection)
=======

As a precursor to my weather station project I spent time experimenting with various analog and digital temperature sensors, and with different ways to display temperature information including LCD and in binary with LEDs.  Even a basic thermometer is useful, and so this has come to be my standard Arduino demo program (even moreso than blinking an LED).

Collected here are a number of thermometer sketches that us a variety of digital and analog sensors, display information in a variety of ways, and log timestamped observed temperature data on a micro-SD card (using a real time clock).
